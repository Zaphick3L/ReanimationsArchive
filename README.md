# The Reanimation Gallery.
Yes, that's right...
I decided to make all my reanimates i edited/made/modifed publicly.
Any new reanimate i will work on will not be here because i'll only make one and stick to it.

# Any reanimations that were made in 2022> or Winter 2021 Are no longer using anyones code, they are 100% created by me... ONLY ME.

Those people I am gonna credit for most of stuff:
# phere#4106
  - LookVector Velocity Addon on 3/4/2022 Reanimate
# Pararell_X:
  - The R15 Align Values i used back in 2021.
# Syntax_64 / Foreach / Mizt
  - The Shiba Reanimations
  - Some of the reanimations that use mizt stuff (align, reset).
# TypicalUsername
  - His mizt reanimate edit i used for Gelatek Hub V1 Reanimate 
# Bedra
  - That old jitterless method used before corner clip glitch patch.
# Please don't fork this git as well for no reason or skidding reasons.
